# drbd_fence_peer_exit_code is per the exit code
# convention of the DRBD "fence-peer" handler,
# obviously.
# 3: peer is already outdated or worse (e.g. inconsistent)
# 4: peer has been successfully fenced
# 5: peer not reachable, assumed to be dead
# 6: please outdate yourself, peer is known (or likely)
#    to have better data, or is even currently primary.
#    (actually, currently it is "peer is active primary now", but I'd like to
#    change that meaning slightly towards the above meaning)
# 7: peer has been STONITHed, thus assumed to be properly fenced
#    XXX IMO, this should rather be handled like 5, not 4.

# NOTE:
#    On loss of all cluster comm (cluster split-brain),
#    without STONITH configured, you always still risk data divergence.
#
# There are two timeouts:
#
# --timeout is how long we poll the DC for a definite "unreachable" node state,
# before we deduce that the peer is in fact still reachable.
# This should be longer than "dead time" or "stonith timeout",
# the time it takes the cluster manager to declare the other node dead and
# shoot it, just to be sure.
#
# --dc-timeout is how long we try to contact a DC before we give up.
# This is neccessary, because placing the constraint will fail (with some
# internal timeout) if no DC was available when we request the constraint.
# Which is likely if the DC crashed. Then the surviving DRBD Primary needs
# to wait for a new DC to be elected. Usually such election takes only
# fractions of a second, but it can take much longer (the default election
# timeout in pacemaker is ~2 minutes!).
#
# a) Small-ish (1s) timeout, medium (10..20s) dc-timeout:
#    Intended use case: fencing resource-only, no STONITH configured.
#
#    Even with STONITH properly configured, on cluster-split-brain this method
#    risks to complete transactions to user space which can be lost due to
#    STONITH later.
#
#    With dual-primary setup (cluster file system),
#    you should use method b).
#
# b) timeout >= deadtime, dc-timeout > timeout
#    Intended use case: fencing resource-and-stonith, STONITH configured.
#
#    Difference to a)
#
#       If peer is still reachable according to the cib,
#	we first poll the cib until timeout has elapsed,
#	or the peer becomes definetely unreachable.
#
#	This gives STONITH the chance to kill us.
#	With "fencing resource-and-stontith;" this protects us against
#	completing transactions to userland which might otherwise be lost.
#
#	We then place the constraint (if we are UpToDate), as explained below,
#	and return reachable/unreachable according to our last cib status poll.
#

#
#    replication link loss, current Primary calls this handler:
#	We are UpToDate, but we potentially need to wait for a DC election.
#	Once we have contacted the DC, we poll the cib until the peer is
#	confirmed unreachable, or timeout expired.
#	Then we place the constraint, and are done.
#
#	If it is complete communications loss, one will stonith the other.
#	For two-node clusters with no-quorum-policy=ignore, we will have a
#	deathmatch shoot-out, which the former DC is likely to win.
#
#	In dual-primary setups, if it is only replication link loss, both nodes
#	will call this handler, but only one will succeed to place the
#	constraint. The other will then typically need to "commit suicide".
#
#    Primary crash, promotion of former Secondary:
#	DC-election, if any, will have taken place already.
#	We are UpToDate, we place the constraint, done.
#
#    node or cluster crash, promotion of Secondary with replication link down:
#	We are "Only" Consistent.  Usually any "init-dead-time" or similar has
#	expired already, and the cib node states are already authoritative
#	without doing additional waiting.  If the peer is still reachable, we
#	place the constraint - if the peer had better data, it should have a
#	higher master score, and we should not have been asked to become
#	primary.  If the peer is not reachable, we don't do anything, and drbd
#	will refuse to be promoted. This is neccessary to avoid problems
#	With data diversion, in case this "crash" was due to a STONITH operation,
#	maybe the reboot did not fix our cluster communications!
#
#	Note that typically, if STONITH is in use, it has been done on any
#	unreachable node _before_ we are promoted, so the cib should already
#	know that the peer is dead - if it is.
